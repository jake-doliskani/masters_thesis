For cryptographic purposes, counting points on the jacobian variety of a given hyperelliptic curve 
is of great importance. There has been several approaches to obtain the cardinality of such a group, 
specially for hyperelliptic curves of genus 2. The best known algorithm for counting points on genus 
2 curves over prime fields of large characteristic is a variant of Schoof's genus 1 algorithm. 
Following a recent work of Gaudry and Schost, we show how to speed up the current state of the art 
genus 2 point counting algorithm by proposing various computational improvements to its basic 
arithmetical ingredients.
